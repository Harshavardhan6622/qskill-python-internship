# Employee Data Analysis using Python

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze employee data from a CSV file, calculate average salary, and visualize key relationships using graphs.

## Dataset
The dataset (`data.csv`) contains employee information such as:
- Age
- Salary
- Department

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Tasks Performed
- Loaded employee data from a CSV file using Pandas
- Calculated the average salary of employees
- Created multiple visualizations to understand data distribution and relationships

## Visualizations
1. **Bar Chart**
   - Displays the number of employees in each department
   - Saved as `bar_chart.png`

2. **Scatter Plot**
   - Shows the relationship between employee age and salary
   - Saved as `scatter_plot.png`

3. **Heatmap**
   - Displays correlation between numerical variables
   - Saved as `heatmap.png`

## Observations
- Some departments have a higher number of employees compared to others
- Salary tends to increase with age, as observed in the scatter plot
- There is a visible correlation between age and salary in the heatmap

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization techniques using Python. It helps in understanding employee data patterns and relationships effectively.
