# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Objective
To predict house prices based on area, number of bedrooms, and age of the house.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
- Loaded house price dataset
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated model using MAE and MSE
- Predicted price for a new house

## Observations
- House price increases with area.
- Newer houses tend to have higher prices.
- Linear Regression provides reasonable predictions for small datasets.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates basic machine learning workflow using Linear Regression.
